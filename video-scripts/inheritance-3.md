review single parent

```
contract X {
    string public name;

    constructor(string memory _name) public {
        name = _name;
    }
}

contract B is X("Fixed input") {

}

contract C is X {
    constructor() X("Another way to hard code input") public {

    }
}

contract D is X {
    constructor(string memory _name) D(_name) public {

    }
}
```

multiple parents

```
contract Y {
    string public text;

    constructor(string memory _text) public {
        text = _text;
    }
}

contract B is X("Fixed input"), Y("Another fixed input") {

}

contract C is X, Y {
    // no comma between X, Y
    constructor() X("Fixed input") Y("Another fixed input") public {

    }
}

contract D is X, Y {
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _text) X(_name) Y(_text) public {

    }
}

```

# order

- order of constructor
  The constructors will always be executed in the linearized order,
  regardless of the order in which their arguments are provided in the
  inheriting contractâ€™s constructor.

```
contract X {
    event Log(string message);

    string public name;

    constructor(string memory _name) public {
        name = _name;
        emit Log(_name);
    }
}

contract Y {
    event Log(string message);
    string public text;

    constructor(string memory _text) public {
        text = _text;
        emit Log(_text);
    }
}

contract B is X("Fixed input"), Y("Another fixed input") {

}

contract C is X, Y {
    // no comma between X, Y
    constructor() X("Fixed input") Y("Another fixed input") public {

    }
}

contract D is X, Y {
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _text) X(_name) Y(_text) public {

    }
}

contract E is X, Y {
    constructor() X("X was called") Y("Y was called") public {

    }
}

contract F is X, Y {
    constructor() Y("Y was called") X("X was called") public {

    }
}

```

# shadow

Unlike functions, state variables cannot be overridden by re-declaring it in the child contract.

Let's learn how to correctly override inherited state variables.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

contract A {
    address public addr = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001;

    function getAddress() public view returns (address) {
        return addr;
    }
}

// Wrong way to override state variables
contract B is A {
    address public addr = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002;
}

// Correct way to override state variables
contract C is A {
    constructor() public {
        addr = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000003;
    }
}
```
